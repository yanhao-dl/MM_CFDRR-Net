## 1. Required dataset: FOR (Flash-Only Reflection Removal)

We conduct experiments on the public **FOR** dataset released by:

Lei, C., Chen, Q.: *Robust Reflection Removal with Reflection-Free Flash-Only Cues*. CVPR 2021.
DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01457](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01457)

### How to obtain

1. Visit the official project page/repository associated with the CVPR 2021 paper above.
2. Use the **official download links/scripts** provided by the dataset authors to obtain the data.
3. Place the downloaded files under this repository as described below.

> If the official source provides multiple subsets (e.g., aligned/misaligned), download the subsets needed for your experiments.

## 2. Expected directory structure

After downloading and extracting the dataset, organize it as follows:

```text
data/
  FOR/
    raw/                # original downloaded files (do not modify)
    processed/          # processed outputs generated by scripts (created by you)
    splits/             # train/val/test split files (created by you or provided)
```

* **raw/**: store the dataset exactly as downloaded.
* **processed/**: store any resized/normalized/packed data generated by preprocessing scripts.
* **splits/**: store split files (e.g., `train.txt`, `val.txt`, `test.txt`) or JSON/YAML split configs.

> If the official dataset already provides split files, place them under `data/FOR/splits/`.

---

## 3. Preprocessing (placeholder)

Preprocessing scripts and exact commands will be provided in this repository **after a positive editorial decision / acceptance**, together with full training and inference code.

For now, we recommend keeping:

* the **original** downloaded data under `data/FOR/raw/`
* any intermediate outputs under `data/FOR/processed/`
* any split files under `data/FOR/splits/`

---

## 4. Notes on reproducibility

* Please ensure your environment (Python/PyTorch/CUDA versions) matches the versions listed in the repository root (`requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`) once available.
* Evaluation metrics (PSNR / SSIM / LPIPS) and protocol details are documented in the manuscript and will be matched in the released code.
